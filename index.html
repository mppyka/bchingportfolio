        <p>Hi, <br> My name is Martin Pyka and this site will look at the work of comic book artist Brian Ching, referencing key projects that show how his style has changed over 2 decades of penciling different series for Dark Horse, Marvel, and DC comics. This portfolio will also look at the process of his work as his pencils are finished with inks and colors by other artists.</p>
