        <p>Between working on Kotor, Ching also added his talents to the comic book adaptation of the video game "Star Wars: The Force Unleased" in 2008, colored by Michael Atiyeh. Above is the Ching's work alone while we see how Atiyeh's colors and Michael Heisler's lettering adds to the page below.</p>
