        <p>When I decided to be a Design and Cinema & Digital Media Double Major at UC Davis with a focus towards storyboards and graphic design, I was inspired by the comics I read growing up which incorporated brilliant artwork and storytelling, including the work of Brian Ching, Michael Atiyeh and my previous teacher Walden Wong. My resume includes designing the yearbook covers for my 8th and Junior year, as well as my work at Canada college in Redwood City and the Academy of Art in San Francisco. Under my Instagram account, I share my artwork which mainly consists of graphite and ink as well as using digital programs such as Illustrator and Photoshop. Below are some links to my artwork and artists who have inspired me.</p>
